## Difference between mvc controller and web api controller

MVC and Web API are two different frameworks used for building web applications, and they have different purposes.

A MVC Controller is a class that controls the flow of data between the Model and the View. It handles user requests, retrieves data from the Model, and passes it to the View for rendering. In an MVC architecture, the Controller is responsible for handling user input and making decisions about which Model methods to call and which View to display.

A Web API Controller, on the other hand, is a specialized type of MVC Controller that is designed specifically for building RESTful Web APIs. It responds to HTTP requests from clients and returns data in a specified format, usually JSON or XML. Unlike an MVC Controller, a Web API Controller does not render a View or handle user input. Instead, it provides a simple and flexible way to expose business logic to a variety of clients, including web and mobile applications.

In summary, the main difference between an MVC Controller and a Web API Controller is their purpose. An MVC Controller is used to handle user input and render Views, while a Web API Controller is used to provide data to clients through a RESTful API.
